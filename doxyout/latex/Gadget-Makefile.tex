\-A number of features of \-G\-A\-D\-G\-E\-T-\/2 are controlled with compile-\/time options in the makefile rather than by the parameterfile. \-This has been done in order to allow the generation of highly optimised binaries by the compiler, even when the underlying source code allows for many different ways to run the code.

\-The makefile contains a dummy list of all available compile-\/time options, with most of them commented out by default. \-To activate a certain feature, the corresponding parameter should be commented in, and given the desired value, where appropriate. \-Below, a brief guide to these options is included.

{\bfseries \-Important \-Note\-:} \-Whenever one of the compile-\/time options described below is modified, a full recompilation of the code may be necessary. \-To guarantee that this is done when a simple {\bfseries make} is specified, all source files have been specified in the \-Makefile as being dependent on the \-Makefile itself. \-Alternatively, one can also issue the command {\bfseries make clean}, which will erase all object files, followed by {\bfseries make}.

\-Note that the above technique has the disadvantage that different simulations may require different binaries of \-G\-A\-D\-G\-E\-T-\/2. \-If several simulations are run concurrently, there is hence the danger that a simulation is started/resumed with the `wrong' binary. \-Note that while \-G\-A\-D\-G\-E\-T-\/2 checks the plausibility of some of the most important code options, this is not done for all of them. \-To minimise the risk of using the wrong executable for a simulation, it is recommended to produce a separate executable for each simulation that is run. \-For example, a good strategy is to make a copy of the whole code together with its makefile in the output directory of each simulation run, and then to use this copy to compile the code and to run the simulation.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \-P\-M\-G\-R\-I\-D=128} \par
 \-This enables the \-Tree\-P\-M method, i.\-e. the long-\/range force is computed with a \-P\-M-\/algorithm, and the short range force with the tree. \-The parameter has to be set to the size of the mesh that should be used, e.\-g.$\sim$64, 96, 128, etc. \-The mesh dimensions need not necessarily be a power of two, but the \-F\-F\-T is fastest for such a choice. \-Note\-: \-If the simulation is not in a periodic box, then a \-F\-F\-T method for vacuum boundaries is employed, using a mesh with dimension twice that specified by {\bfseries \-P\-M\-G\-R\-I\-D}.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \-P\-L\-A\-C\-E\-H\-I\-G\-H\-R\-E\-S\-R\-E\-G\-I\-O\-N=1+8} \par
 \-If this option is set (will only work together with {\bfseries \-P\-M\-G\-R\-I\-D}), then the long range force is computed in two stages\-: \-One \-Fourier-\/grid is used to cover the whole simulation volume, allowing the computation of the large-\/scale force. \-A second \-Fourier mesh is placed on the region occupied by `high-\/resolution' particles, allowing the computation of an intermediate-\/scale force. \-Finally, the force on very small scales is computed by the tree. \-This procedure can be useful for `zoom-\/simulations', where the majority of particles (the high-\/res particles) are occupying only a small fraction of the volume. \-To activate this option, the parameter needs to be set to an integer that encodes the particle types that make up the high-\/res particles in the form of a bit mask. \-For example, if types 0, 1, and 4 are the high-\/res particles, then the parameter should be set to {\bfseries \-P\-L\-A\-C\-E\-H\-I\-G\-H\-R\-E\-S\-R\-E\-G\-I\-O\-N=1+2+16}, i.\-e. to the sum $2^0+2^1+2^4$. \-The spatial region covered by the high-\/res grid is determined automatically from the initial conditions. \-Note\-: \-If a periodic box is used, the high-\/res zone is not allowed to intersect the box boundaries.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries  \-E\-N\-L\-A\-R\-G\-E\-R\-E\-G\-I\-O\-N=1.\-1} \par
 \-The spatial region covered by the high-\/res zone normally has a fixed size during the simulation, which initially is set to the smallest region that encompasses all high-\/res particles. \-Normally, the simulation will be interrupted if high-\/res particles leave this region in the course of the run. \-However, by setting this parameter to a value larger than one, the high-\/res region can be expanded on the fly. \-For example, setting it to 1.\-4 will enlarge its side-\/length by 40\% in such an event (it remains centred on the high-\/res particles). \-Hence, with such a setting, the high-\/res region may expand or move by a limited amount. \-If in addition {\bfseries \-S\-Y\-N\-C\-H\-R\-O\-N\-I\-Z\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N} is activated, then the code will be able to continue even if high-\/res particles leave the initial high-\/res grid. \-In this case, the code will update the size and position of the grid that is placed onto the high-\/resolution region automatically. \-To prevent that this potentially happens every single \-P\-M step, one should nevertheless assign a value slightly larger than 1 to {\bfseries \-E\-N\-L\-A\-R\-G\-E\-R\-E\-G\-I\-O\-N}.

 \-When this is set, particles may only increase their timestep if the new timestep will put them into synchronisation with the higher time level. \-This typically means that only on half of the timesteps of a particle an increase of its step may occur. \-Especially for \-Tree\-P\-M runs, it is usually advisable to set this option.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \-F\-L\-E\-X\-S\-T\-E\-P\-S} \par
 \-This is an alternative to \-S\-Y\-N\-C\-H\-R\-O\-N\-I\-Z\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N. \-Particle timesteps are here allowed to be integer multiples of the minimum timestep that occurs among the particles, which in turn is rounded down to the nearest power-\/of-\/two devision of the total simulated timespan. \-This option distributes particles more evenly over individual system timesteps, particularly once a simulation has run for a while, and may then result in a reduction of work-\/load imbalance losses.

 \-When this option is set, the code will try to `anticipate' timestep changes by extrapolating the change of the acceleration into the future. \-This in general improves the long-\/term integration behaviour of periodic orbits, because then the adaptive integration becomes more akin to a strictly time reversible integrator. \-Note\-: \-This option has no effect if \-F\-L\-E\-X\-S\-T\-E\-P\-S is set.

 \-If this is activated, the code will not terminate when the timestep falls below the value of {\bfseries \-Min\-Size\-Timestep} specified in the parameterfile. \-This is useful for runs where one wants to enforce a constant timestep for all particles. \-This can be done by activating this option, and by setting {\bfseries \-Min\-Size\-Timestep} and {\bfseries \-Max\-Size\-Timestep} to an equal value.
